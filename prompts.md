Inspried by this architecture let's try utilize juice out of it @https://www.shloked.com/writing/openpoke 

for following: 

Accelerating the distribution of medical innovation via an always-on multi-agent system.

Problem Statement
Real-world adoption of promising therapies often lags behind scientific evidence and regulatory approvalâ€”especially for rare conditions. We target:

Diseases with emerging or established therapies that remain inaccessible or under-adopted in practice.
Conditions that are clinically addressable but practically unreached.
Diseases for which effective interventions exist or are imminent, yet patients still lack access.
Barriers include insurer friction, fragmented care delivery, and siloed information.

Vision & Objectives
Build an ambient AI agent that:

Continuously monitors medical research and regulatory approvals.
Maintains a dynamic memory of findings.
Matches breakthroughs to clinician queries or proactively surfaces relevant insights.
Suggests next actions and predicts follow-up steps.

Let's talk about how we can uitlize poke's architecutre to solve this problem. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
ok i think one feedback is that execution agents is dynaimcally cretaed from interaction agent with specific domain/diease as we may assume that it's better to have one specific target diease/area for that execution agent to research them in their own persistent context. we will talk more about background monitors how we can simplify this rather than having sepcific pathses of monitoring. We can think very general about memories similar to poke.
Critical design questions
1. that should be really dynamic for user's query. We can utilize perplexity api (as they have domain filter) to give web search tools for the execution agent. 

2. i think we should do web based for this project
3. i am thinking of execution agent setting their own automation while working on it. so it has tools for research, and background task, so that when research should be triggered later due to lack of evidences, it should use background tool to schedule task later autonomously to perfrom the research again. In this case, the agent will learn the pattern from their own context,history and able to simplify how monitoring works. 

4. General LLM.
6. we will talk about techincal details once we finalize high level architecture and PRD. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
1. To simplify, it's probably better to have that decision be up to interaction agent. Yet we should also try to have tools that show/get all existing execution/research agents and able to delegate task to the specific existing agent that has most approparite context for the user's new query

2. It should be based on the user's query, and requirements that user want -- which means we proabably wanna reply back to ask specific user's requriments for research task. And also we should be able to have an email tool for execution agent so that if for example, the query and reqruiment expect agent to be highly autonomous to solve the query, it must be able to email to the original author of the key paper to seek for clarity and continue to research/solve until it has enough evidences to answer user's query. So we shouldn't really have HARD rules. we may introduce some guidlines of how it should behave. But the whole point is how we should construct tools for interaction and execution agents. 

3. based on the user's requirments. 
4. We don't need to overengineer this. We give tools with highest leverage arguments in our context for web search tool for the research/execution agent, then it should be able to figure out itself well. 


I will answer technical design after as some of the questions can be indirectly answered from the above key design decisions. ---------------------------------------------------------------

let's add agent name for research agent. do u think get agent details via id is necessary? why so? -- also if it's necessary i think we don't wanna get research history entirely as the whole point of ONE interaction agent is to keep the context very minimal and necessary. 

when (delegate->message) message to agent, let's have message rather than task description. to keep things more general. 

also spawn research agent, let's have argument to be more general, agent description and message and agent name-- so message itself can capture user's requirments and its task. Let's keep things minimal and simple and add extra layers if necessary. 

for execution agent tools, reread the article to understand how they have background task integration. 

and the point of the architecture is that execution/research agent should not communicate directly to the user. It should be messaged through interaction agent who orchastrates research agents and communicates with user. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
i feel like having file system as external memory would be good and help simplyfing things better. And we can avoid losing important details when compressing history. 

And i think only research agents have write files (so it can write a complete report md file) 

and then interaction agents have list, read files (so it can fetch it and give summary to the user and it can link/path to the file so that user can click and see the entire detail report from resarch agent)

---------------------------------------------------------------
we probably want tool interace to be more genereal -- NOT only report artifact but also more types of memory should be written. so just like we refactored task -> message, plz refactor to be more general system. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
or actually i think it's better to have interaction agent to also have write file as it can act like writing preference/user profile via file system. and it may also get benefit from compressing history. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
yet i think memory directory structure should be very strict so that execution agent can only view its own sandbox -- not other executions and parent (interaction agent)

for interaction agent do u think it's better to have access to its subagents? 

---------------------------------------------------------------
i mean for option B it can still answer scnario 1 by messaging to its research agent who has right context. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
i think from agent's interface, it should think like it can view and list its own sandbox file system. Which means we have a root path already setup for the each agent and when accessing/listing/reading/writing, it is accessing through relative path from its own unique root path. 

Also btw that "memory" directory is just an example, we could also default to set specific names of directories so that agent can interface and start better. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

let's refactor @ARCHITECTURE.md make sure no verbose and keep things concise. 

btw list files shoulnd't take no argument. it should just show all files for that specific agent which just called this tool based on its root path. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
btw can u elaborate wait() tool?

---------------------------------------------------------------

oh is it because when background agent triggers reserach agent and then it triggers interaction agent IT MUST somehow finish its ReAct -- so giving wait() as a tool, it just means nothing to message back to the user. Finish it's loop?

---------------------------------------------------------------
ok whats next we should talk about to keep things move forward

---------------------------------------------------------------
can u spawn subagent to research on option 1? if so try to look for best practice for Cloudflare tech stack when building multiagent system -- yet we probably no need to have ALL FEATURES use nia tools as well. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

let's define mvp scope ask 5 important questiosn

---------------------------------------------------------------

1. A 
2. C -- so same interface when i explore (web + dashboard for the reviewer and debugging purpose! to inspect how agent works under the hood)
3. let's talk abt it later
4. real as we will integrate with perplexity api, but we will write mock tests as well 
5. 
- parallel should be easy honestly, yet it should be async 
- clean UI
- email impl

---------------------------------------------------------------

A. seperate page would be nice yet it should be sync so that when we should be able to inspect and chat simultaniotusly in real time

B. C
C. no need to talk abt this. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
let's tackle option 1. build core tools research first. follow agent coding step 1. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

rename spwan -> create
1. i think agent managment should be priortized first. 

2. A seems right approach
3. yes i do ill provide it later
4. research abt how cloudfare appraoch email tool for the agent
5. async seems right approach

Make sure to research each of those aspects -- do not assume anything. 

and try to use nia tools, refer official docs, for pattern, syntax, and best practice...etc to keep things clean. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
for test documentation i was thinking of documenting each 
   test files of what its testing in high level plain enlgish so
    that this file can act like a higher lanague i can interface
    with rather than touching test files. and u act like a 
   compiler to inspect/generate/review this contract. -- try to 
   resesearch about this approach in general i think there r 
   people out there try to have this approach for general 
   agentic coding framework. where user interact with md files 
   and coding agent like u a compiler. And we try to target test
    md files specifically.


---------------------------------------------------------------

1. yes but let's differ this plan after finishing tests
   yes tests only then adding specs to 1-2 ocmplex modules to 
   see if the pattern scales well. 

   also update our agents.md for this new workflow spec driven. 
   keep things concsie.  overall i love the idea i agree with ur
    recommnedations.

---------------------------------------------------------------
i want md instead of txt when writing files as in the future 
   we can render markdown format report to the user later

---------------------------------------------------------------
i have wrote some comments for phase 1. let's also write spec
    for this phase 1 rather than deferring to write spec at the 
   end.  we could add details and discuss more about phase 2 
   after phase 1 -- bc we can introduce patterns that agreed 
   while doing phase 1 together
