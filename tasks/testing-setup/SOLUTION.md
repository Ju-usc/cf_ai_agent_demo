# Testing Setup - Final Solution

## Problem
Couldn't test VirtualFs because importing `env` from `cloudflare:test` triggered loading of:
- `agents` SDK → `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` → `ajv` (CommonJS module)
- Workers runtime can't handle CommonJS in tests → `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'`

## Root Cause
**You're NOT using MCP directly** - it's a transitive dependency of Cloudflare's `agents` SDK that breaks testing.

## Solution: Mock R2 Instead of Using Real Bindings

Instead of importing `env.R2` from `cloudflare:test`, we created a simple in-memory mock:

```typescript
class MockR2Bucket {
  private storage = new Map<string, ArrayBuffer>();

  async get(key: string) { ... }
  async put(key: string, value: string | ArrayBuffer) { ... }
  async list(options?: { prefix?: string }) { ... }
  async delete(key: string) { ... }
}

// Use mock instead of real R2
beforeEach(() => {
  mockR2 = new MockR2Bucket();
  fs = new VirtualFs(mockR2 as any, prefix);
});
```

## Results

✅ **10/10 tests passing** without any SDK issues:

1. Constants validation (2 tests)
2. write_file operations (3 tests)
3. read_file operations (3 tests)  
4. list_files operations (2 tests)

## Key Insight

**VirtualFs has ZERO dependencies on agents SDK** - it only uses R2Bucket types from Workers runtime. By mocking R2, we bypass the entire SDK loading chain.

## Benefits

- ✅ Fast tests (no network, no real R2)
- ✅ Deterministic (in-memory storage, no state leakage)
- ✅ No SDK dependency issues
- ✅ Easy to debug (can inspect mock storage directly)
- ✅ Works with any R2-compatible interface

## Trade-offs

- ❌ Not testing against real R2 behavior
- ❌ Mock might diverge from actual R2 API
- ✅ BUT: R2 is stable and we test core logic (path handling, content management)

## When to Use Real R2

For **integration tests** that verify:
- Actual R2 API compatibility
- Large file handling
- R2-specific error cases
- Performance characteristics

For **unit tests** (current approach), mocks are perfect - we're testing VirtualFs logic, not R2 itself.

tests/unit/file_system.test.ts          NEW - 10 passing tests
vitest.config.ts                        MODIFIED - DO bindings
tasks/testing-setup/plan.md             MODIFIED - completion status
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npx vitest

# Run specific file
npx vitest tests/unit/file_system.test.ts

# Watch mode
npx vitest --watch
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't assume you need real bindings** - mocks often work better for unit tests
2. **VirtualFs is independent** - doesn't need agents SDK to function
3. **Transitive dependencies can be problematic** - MCP/ajv issue hidden deep in chain
4. **Mock what you don't control** - R2 API is external, our logic is what we're testing
5. **Tests should be fast** - in-memory mocks >>> real network calls

---

**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 & 2 complete. Ready to add more tests following this pattern.
