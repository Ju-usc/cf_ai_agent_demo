# Minimal Frontend Review

## Implementation Summary
- Scaffolded Vite + React + Tailwind frontend with chat and dashboard pages wired to existing backend contracts.
- Added shared API helper, navigation shell, and streaming chat UI driven by `useChat`.
- Exposed `/api/agents` endpoint and `getAgents` Durable Object method to power dashboard listing.

## Verification
- `npm run build` inside `frontend/` ✅
- `npm run test` at repository root ✅

## Follow-ups / Notes
- Frontend build reports moderate npm audit findings inherited from tooling; defer to dependency management task.
- Consider enhancing chat UI with markdown rendering and persistent storage in future iterations.
